### How it's made
It is made using the Polygon, Moralis, IPFS, NFTPort, and Chainlink VRF to add randomization in the perks like speed boosters for Crypto Chicken Run and score multiplier for Symbals. We have used express as backend and simple HTML js in the frontend, Implemented a game using this stack. Stored the blockchain data like scores and levels. The burning feature will introduce a need for new NFTs which will increase the use of NFTs in the marketplace. NFTPort helps in this majorly by giving an easy and efficient way for minting multiple NFTs whose collection can also be deployed on the OpenSea marketplace. 
We have used Chainlink VRF random number generator to implement randomization in the current score multiplier.

Our motive behind this was to develop a conversion engine that will be provided as a service to web2 games and its developer and they would be able to easily implement web3 features in their games.
